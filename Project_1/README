Question 1:
	
	DIAGRAM:
		
		    /--	Child 1
	Parent---------	Child 2
		    \--	Child 3
	
	EXPLANATION:
	
	argv[1] is equal to four,
	and the for loop starts at
	1 and checks against < 4.
	In the loop, we check if 
	the value returned by
	fork() is 1, if so, 
	we are now a child process,
	we break out of the loop, 
	and print our parent pid
	along with our own. Then we
	sleep. If the pid is not 1,
	we are the parent process
	and we continue to create 
	more child processes until
	the loop is finished. We then
	print our parent pid (which is
	1 since we are the parent 
	process) and our own pid
	(the same pid each of the 
	3 child processes will print)
	and then sleep and exit.

Question 2:
	
DIAGRAM:
	
Parent----------Child----------Child------------Child-----------Child
	
Explanation:

argv[1] is 4. The loop
runs from 0 to i < 4. This
means the loop will run 4 times.
The first iteration, the parent will
create a child. A pid of 0 denotes 
a parent, so the parent breaks and
prints its ppid and pid. The child pid
is 1 so it continues the loop. It is
now the parent of the newly created child
process, and is now a parent. It breaks
out of the loop and prints, while the
new child continues the cycle. This
continues until the loop is finished. 



Question 3:

DIAGRAM:

						   
			    /--	Child1-----------------	Child1
	   ----	Child1---------	Child2----------------- Child1
	   |

	   |		    /--	Child1----------------- Child1
Parent---------	Child2---------	Child2----------------- Child1
	   |		    
	   |		    
           |		    /-- Child1----------------- Child1
	   ---- Child3--------- Child2----------------- Child1

EXPLANATION:

argv[1] is 3, and the loop
starts at 0 and goes to 3. 
This means the loop will run 3 times.
The for loop only breaks if a process
is not successfully created. This means that
every new child will make 1 less children than its parent
for 3 iterations. We get a tree like structure, where
the parent makes three children, children in tier
1 will make 2 children each, and children in tier
3 will make 1 child each.
